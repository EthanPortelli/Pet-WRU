		<h3> Description of website </h3>
		<p>Pet WRU is a platform designed to help reunite lost pets with their owners.
            Our website offers a simple and accessible space where pet owners can report
            missing animals by creating digital flyers. These flyers are displayed on a
            separate page in a list, and include key details such as the petâ€™s name, color,
            age, and contact information. Other users can view and comment on posts to share
            updates or offer assistance. Once a pet is found, the flyer can be updated accordingly
            and moved to a "Found Pets" section, offering encouragement to others still searching.</p>

		<h3> Why we created Pet WRU </h3>
		<p>Losing a pet is a heartbreaking experience for any pet owner. Whether it is a dog that has
            slipped out of the backyard, a cat that has wandered too far from home, or even a bird that
            flew away, the emotional toll of having a beloved animal go missing is immense. The distress
            caused by losing a pet cannot be overstated. For many people, pets are considered to be their
            family members, and the anxiety and fear associated with their disappearance can be overwhelming.
            Many pet owners feel a sense of helplessness, especially when the available tools seem insufficient
            or out of reach due to financial constraints. They are seen as being part of the family, and to
            lose them can be truly emotionally devastating.
